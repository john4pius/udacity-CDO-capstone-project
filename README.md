# UDACITY CLOUD DEVOPS CAPSTONE PROJECT

In this project i have develop a CI/CD pipeline for micro services applications with blue/green deployment. You will also develop your Continuous Integration steps as you see fit, but must at least include typographical checking (aka ‚Äúlinting‚Äù).

I have set up Continuous Deployment, which will include:

* Pushing the built Docker container(s) to the Docker repository.
* Deploying these Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster. I used AWS Kubernetes as a Service. I have used Cloudformation to deploy the Kubernetes cluster. 
*Jenkins was used to run these as an independent pipeline.

In this project I have applied the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

* Working in AWS
* Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building pipelines
* Working with CloudFormation to deploy clusters(this could also be achieved using Ansible)
* Building Kubernetes clusters
* Building Docker containers in pipelines


Completing this project involves the following steps;
- Step 1: Propose and Scope the Project
- Step 2: Use Jenkins, and implement blue/green or rolling deployment.
- Step 3: Pick AWS Kubernetes as a Service, or build your own Kubernetes cluster.
- Step 4: Build your pipeline
- Step 5: Test your pipeline
